This is a To do List app I created based on a youtube video done by [Great Stack](https://youtu.be/-oP7JK_rXUI?si=YtfyQ5bXFYwXOUqF).

I followed the video to create the app the way he specified then I adjusted it to be custom based on some additions I wanted to add or elements I wanted to improve. The things I changed are below:

1. Made it responsive
2. Change the colour theme and icons
3. Changed what happens on hover with multiple elements
4. There were a number of things left out, in the youtube video, that meant I had to do a lot of work to get this to work as outlined in the video so I did a lot of clean up work to ensure the code worked as intended.
5. Got the progress bar and numbers to store in local storage (previously it as just the tasks)
